# spotify-data-analysis
In this project I will analyze a Spotify dataset with information regarding 52,000 songs,
discovering the influence factors on the popularity and key audio features that distinguish
different genres. I will use the information I gather from the data to generate insightful
conclusions, which can then be used to improve Spotify’s music recommendation system and to
make the user experience better. The data set contains attributes for each song ranging from
duration, danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness,
valence and tempo. Categorical variables such as explicit content or mode (major or minor) are
extra dimensions for analysis. Besides the audio features, the metadata like artist(s), album
name, track name, popularity, and Spotify-assigned genre provide additional information about
the current music scene.

The process of preparing the dataset for analysis entails a number of essential steps, among
which are dimension reduction, data cleaning, and data transformation. Dimension reduction
techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will be used to decrease the dimensionality
of the dataset while keeping as much relevant information as possible. This will ease the
analysis by simplifying the data and preventing overfitting.

Data cleansing is another important step of the preprocessing phase, where I will deal with
issues like missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data. The concept of data cleaning
is based on methods like imputation of the missing values, outlier detection and removal, and
ensuring the consistency of the data formats and units. Through a thorough data cleaning, I
intend to ensure the quality and integrity of the dataset.

The data will be transformed so it is optimized for analysis. This may involve standardizing the
numerical features onto a uniform scale, enabling machine learning algorithms to perform
better, or sorting the categorical variables into different categories that need to be analyzed and
transforming them to make them suitable for analysis. For example, the nominal variables can
be one-hot encoded and the ordinal variables can be ordinal encoded.

To make sure the results can be reproduced and to verify this project’s originality, I will trigger
the random number generator with a verification number (17764741). Hence, you will be able to
repeat my experiments accurately and compare the data from different runs of the same
analysis. Through the use of a fixed seed value for random processes, the random number
generator is seeded, and thus the results of the experiments are made more reliable and the
validity of my findings is increased.

To sum up, dimension reduction, data cleaning, and data transformation are the key activities
that I am doing in the preprocessing of my analysis. Seeding and these techniques allows me to
guarantee the quality, integrity, and reproducibility of my analyses.

During this project, I will also use statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and data
visualization techniques to discover the hidden patterns and trends in the dataset. With
adherence to the principles of data science and academic integrity, I want to produce analyses
that will be robust and provide actionable insights for Spotify stakeholders.
